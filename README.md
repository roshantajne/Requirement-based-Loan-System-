# Innovative Agricultural Loan System

The Innovative Agricultural Loan System is inspired by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's model of lending to farmers. This system revolutionizes traditional agricultural lending by providing essential farming items to local farmers instead of hard cash, thereby reducing their cash requirement by 70%. 

After cultivation, the organization reclaims a portion of the total production as payment and interest for the items provided, ensuring a sustainable and mutually beneficial arrangement.
